 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to improve performance.</p>

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. A common example is O(n), which means the memory usage grows linearly with the input.</p>
